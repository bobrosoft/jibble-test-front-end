Based on my [angular4-webpack-starter](https://github.com/bobrosoft/angular4-webpack-starter)

## Prerequisites
- Node 6+

## Installation
- `yarn` or `npm install`

## Run the app
- `yarn server` or `npm run server`

## Tests
- `yarn test` or `npm run test`

## Notes
- I didn't start to divide TopicsListItemComponent further into post, user and album for that simple layout
but that could be done
