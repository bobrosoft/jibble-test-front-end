Based on my [angular4-webpack-starter](https://github.com/bobrosoft/angular4-webpack-starter)

## Notes
- all things covered with unit-tests with 100% coverage
- I didn't bring in whole state manager for that demo (like @ngrx/store),
but wrote a service, TopicsService, fully reactive, MobX-like
- I didn't start to divide TopicsListItemComponent further into post, user and album for that simple layout
but that could be done
